# Automatic Anti-Collision System
Detecting obstacles for the automobile industry is one of the emerging technologies nowadays. An Automatic Anti-Collision System is an automobile safety system that prevents collision among cars and objects automatically. In this paper, I have implemented a prototype of my designed microcontroller based automated can anti-collision system. This system specializes in detecting obstacles by sharp distance sensor and alerts within close distance of collision and hereafter brakes automatically by an actuator in critical distance without the help of a driving person. If somehow driver fails to avoid the collision, this system will automatically stop the vehicle as it monitors the condition of the vehicle continuously. So it is a user friendly and versatile system which can prevent road accidents, reduce the rate of accidents as well as the accidental death of human life. It can be used in any kind of automobile vehicle as it is a cost-effective system.
